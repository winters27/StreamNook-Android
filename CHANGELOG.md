## [8.3.9] - 2026-07-28

## 🎉 Big update rolling through
> A lot landed in this one. Badge drops now run on our own live feed, FrankerFaceZ modifier emotes finally do their thing in chat, any font you like can drive the whole interface, and mod rooms picked up presence, unread counts and a much better composer. Underneath all that is a long list of fixes, including the 7TV channel emotes that had gone missing.

---

### ✨ Features
- Badge drops arrive in seconds. StreamNook holds a live connection to our own badge feed instead of scanning on a timer, so a new Twitch badge appears in your gallery seconds after it is spotted, while the app is open, with no refresh. Anything that dropped while StreamNook was closed is caught up at launch, and each badge announces itself exactly once.
- Badge writeups are ours end to end. What you read on a badge page is the same writeup the Penrose bot posts in our Discord: written the moment a drop is spotted, then edited in place as more details surface. Those edits ride the same feed into the app, so a badge page fills itself in and corrects itself while you are looking at it, rather than depending on an outside source for the details.
- Get pinged the moment a badge drops, even with StreamNook closed. Join the [StreamNook Discord](https://discord.gg/2xvuF9TES7) and pick up the Badges role, and the Penrose bot will post every new drop as it is spotted, then edit that post as more details firm up.
- Badge pages read like a page about the badge instead of a table of fields. How to earn it, when the event runs in your local time, the exact Twitch category with its cover art, cards for the channels involved that take you straight to the stream, and the other badges in the same event. Ids and URLs moved into a Technical details drop-down.
- FrankerFaceZ modifier emotes now do what they do on FFZ. Stack ffzW, ffzX, ffzRainbow, ffzShake and the rest onto an emote and it stretches, flips, tints or animates in chat instead of sitting there as a plain overlay. There is a toggle in Chat settings if you prefer the old look, and the emote picker previews each effect and marks the ones that need an FFZ subscription.
- Use any font you like for the whole interface. Theme > Font has a new Custom option: type a name like Poppins or Bebas Neue and it downloads on the spot, or name a font already installed on your PC and it loads with no download at all. Eight popular picks are one click away.
- Mod Rooms stay with you. Rooms keep running in the background, so the Mods tab carries an unread count, red when someone pinged you, without your having to open it. Moderation settings shows which account rooms are connected as, with Connect and Disconnect.
- Writing in a mod room got a lot better. Messages send instantly and can be retried if they fail, @mentions autocomplete and highlight, images paste straight in and open full size, links are clickable, day and New dividers break up the history, and pressing Up edits your last message.
- Clicking someone in chat opens straight to their messages. That history stays live while the card is open, renders emotes properly, and stays pinned to the newest message until you scroll up. If you would rather land on the profile with their badges and stats, there is a toggle under Chat > User Cards.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- 7TV channel emotes came back. 7TV changed the shape of its channel response and stopped including the emote set inline, and channel emotes silently vanished. StreamNook now fetches the set properly on both Twitch and Kick, and the trending tab works again.
- Chat no longer looks dead just after joining a channel. New messages could stop appearing for the first stretch after a join.
- Drops you had already claimed could show as unclaimed when an old progress record still carried watch minutes.
- A badge queued before its earn window opened now reads as available instead of coming soon.
- The player's LIVE indicator stopped turning into a clock counting up from when you joined.
- The window comes back on the same monitor at the same size after an update restart.
- Mod rooms recover from a dropped connection instead of giving up. A brief network problem no longer asks an already connected account to reconnect, stalled connections are detected and replaced, and reconnecting no longer shows every message twice.
- Emotes typed with extra spaces between them no longer break modifier and zero-width stacking.
- Reply previews show emotes instead of raw emote codes.
- Usernames sit on the same line as the message again instead of floating slightly above it.
- Accent tinting works across the whole app again. Hundreds of surfaces meant to pick up your theme colour were rendering with no tint at all.
- Seasonal and cake-day badges are granted against the server's clock now, so they land on the right day regardless of your PC's date.

### ⚡ Performance
- Chat, the sidebar, the title bar, the player and the Multi Nook grid no longer re-render on unrelated activity. Every toast, mod-log entry and drops poll used to wake the whole app.
- Typing in the chat box no longer re-renders the visible messages.
- Hype train banners, tooltips and Multi Nook tiles stopped doing repaint work on every frame, which shows up most on busy channels and multi-stream layouts.
- 7TV's trending and global emote sets are fetched once and shared instead of once per channel join.

### 🔧 Maintenance
- The Drops page tucks fully collected games into their own collapsible section, so the grid shows what you can still earn.
- The loading widget is now the real StreamNook mark, retinted by your theme.
- Remaining native browser tooltips were replaced with the app's own.
- First-run setup installs one component instead of two.

## [8.3.8] - 2026-07-20

### ✨ Features
- Watch a VOD with its chat in sync. Historical chat now replays alongside the video and scrolls in time with the playhead, so you can follow the conversation even on streams that never kept an on-screen chat box. A header toggle switches between the synced replay and the channel's current live chat.
- See every drop, not just the ones you earn by watching. A new filter on the Drops page switches between "Watch to earn" and "All drops," so purchase and subscription drops are no longer hidden from the list.
- Channel point redemptions now read clearly in chat, showing the reward with its cost and the channel's points icon instead of a bare number.
- Community gift subs collapse into a single announcement that lists the recipients, so a big gift drop no longer floods chat with dozens of separate lines. This applies in both chat and the stream overlay.

## [8.3.7] - 2026-07-17

## 🎉 New: Subscriber milestone badges
> As our first subscribers approach three months, we are rolling out milestone badges for the people who stick around. Reach 3, 6, 9, or 12 months and you unlock a holographic Penrose badge to wear anywhere in StreamNook.

![Subscriber milestone badges](https://cdn.streamnook.app/badges/tenure-lineup.webp)

### ✨ Features
- Prediction outcomes now show emotes in their titles.
- Real-time badge drop alerts, so new Twitch badge drops surface the moment they go live.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Mass gift-sub announcements collapse into a single card that lists the recipients, instead of flooding chat.
- Gift-sub recipients show in their own name color instead of the gifter's.
- Drops automation fixes so mining tracks the correct drop and channel and resumes cleanly.
- The what's-new popup renders release images and keeps descriptions in order.

## [8.3.6] - 2026-07-15

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed YouTube live chat not showing up for some streams. When a creator was genuinely live but YouTube's live shortcut returned their channel page instead of the stream, the chat would silently never load. StreamNook now finds the live stream and connects to its chat directly, and it won't attach to an old stream's replay chat by mistake.

## [8.3.5] - 2026-07-12

### ✨ Features
- Overlay: Added a "Restore chat on reload" option. By default the overlay comes back cleared when you reopen OBS or start a stream; turn it on to bring the last messages back instead.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Overlay: YouTube chat now uses YouTube's own badges and colors instead of Twitch ones. Moderators show the blue shield with a blue name, members show the channel's tier badge with a green name, verified users get the check, and the channel owner appears in a gold name tag, with badges in YouTube's order and at full resolution.
- Drops: Watch time now reports on two paths at once, so drop progress keeps crediting reliably through long sessions.
- Drops: The Drops panel's per-tier bars and "next reward" countdown update live now, instead of only after reopening the panel.
- Updates: The updater no longer gets stuck on the old version when a leftover StreamNook process is still running. It closes any stragglers and completes the swap.

### ⚡ Performance
- Cologne event: The animated backdrop stays smooth in the browser-based overlay view.

## [8.3.4] - 2026-07-12

## Overlay update

This release focuses on the stream chat overlay: new ways to highlight chatters and events, message bubbles, per-source event filters, and more control over what shows and how messages come in.

---

### ✨ Features
- **First-time chatter highlights.** Mark someone's first-ever message in your channel with a Twitch-style pink outline or StreamNook's purple highlight. Pick a custom accent color, add a subtle fill, and give the border an animated accent (Sheen, Pulse, or Chase) that plays as the message lands.
- **Outline event style.** A new look for subs, gifts, and raids: a thin ring in each platform's color, or one fixed color you choose, with an optional fill and the same border animations.
- **Message bubbles.** Each chat message can sit in its own bubble that hugs the text, with rounded, pill, or speech shapes plus adjustable corner radius, color, and opacity. Reads far better over busy gameplay than bare text.
- **Per-source event filters.** Choose which events each platform shows on its own, so you can keep Twitch raids while hiding TikTok gifts without one affecting the other.
- **More entrance animations, each with its own feel.** Drift, Rise, and Stamp join Fade, Slide, and Pop, and every entrance now moves distinctly instead of reading like a plain fade.
- **Chatter display controls.** Show or hide profile pictures (YouTube and TikTok send them), strip the leading @ from handles, and hide the "Replying to" context line. Settings that only affect certain platforms now show which ones at a glance.
- **Overlay housekeeping.** Hide messages containing chosen words or phrases, clamp long messages to a set number of lines so one copypasta can't fill the screen, and auto-remove messages after a set time so a quiet stream doesn't show stale chat.

### 🔧 Maintenance
- Every new overlay setting is searchable from Settings search and the command palette.

## [8.3.3] - 2026-07-10

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **The StreamNook member badge can now be hidden on your overlay.** It appears in the badge providers list alongside 7TV, FFZ, and the rest, and it follows the third-party badges toggle, so switching that off hides every extra badge at once.
- **Your overlay no longer starts from a blank screen after a reload.** It remembers the last messages it showed, so restarting OBS or refreshing the browser source brings recent chat right back.

## [8.3.2] - 2026-07-10

### ✨ Features
- **Consistent emoji across every platform, in the style you choose.** Emojis from Twitch, Kick, YouTube, and TikTok now render in one uniform style on your overlay instead of a mix that changed with your OS. Pick System, Apple, Google, Twitter, or Facebook in the overlay's Appearance settings, with live previews, and Twitter renders as crisp vector art.
- **Custom fonts for your overlay.** Type any Google Font name and it loads instantly, no download needed, with a short guide and a live preview as you type. Fonts installed on your PC work too.
- **Finer control over chat cosmetics.** New toggles to show or hide 7TV paints, StreamNook atmospheres, and third-party badges, and you can turn each badge provider (7TV, FFZ, Chatterino, and more) on or off individually.
- **Hide chat commands from your overlay.** Add a prefix like ! or # to hide every command, or a specific command like !title to hide just that one.
- **A cleaner overlay builder.** The settings are reorganized into clear tabs (Sources, Layout, Appearance, Filters, Events) with a roomier layout, so everything is easy to find.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Custom fonts now preview correctly inside the app,** matching how they already render on the live overlay.
- **Chat history goes deeper and fills in more reliably.** History cards recover sources that were silently coming up empty, keep working for people who use DNS-level ad blockers, and load deeper history in the background without the card freezing.
- **Drops auto-claim actually claims.** Watching a farmed channel now detects when a drop hits 100% and claims it, retries a failed claim instead of giving up for the session, and no longer repeats the "drop ready" notification.
- **Completed and reissued drops show correctly.** Fully earned campaigns no longer show a stray claim button or vanish from the panel, and a reissued reward is no longer mistaken for one you already own.
- **The drops channel picker only shows channels that can actually earn.** For allow-list events, it lists only channels that are live in the campaign's required category, so you don't pick someone who's live but can't credit the drop.
- **Kick reply emotes render properly** instead of showing raw markup.
- **Earned-points notifications use the channel's real name** instead of the lowercase login.
- **Shared links refresh their preview.** Re-sharing a channel link on a later day now shows the current stream in the unfurled preview instead of a stale one.

## [8.3.0] - 2026-07-09

## 🎉 New: Design your stream's chat overlay, hosted for you
> Build a chat overlay right inside StreamNook and paste one link into OBS. It merges Twitch, Kick, YouTube, and TikTok into a single feed and renders 7TV paints, badges, and emotes the way your viewers see them. You design it in a live builder that shows exactly what goes on stream, and it keeps working with StreamNook closed.

Find it under:
```
Settings  >  Stream Overlay
```

---

### ✨ Features
- **Stream Overlay builder.** A new design studio under Settings with a live preview: choose your platforms, fonts, spacing, and background, toggle which events show per platform, convert Super Chat amounts to your currency, and block specific bot names per source. Publish once for a permanent OBS link that stays in sync as you tweak it.
- **Share a stream in one click.** New Share buttons on the player, the right-click menu, and profile cards copy a streamnook.app link, and opening a StreamNook link jumps straight to that channel in the app.
- **Channel point redemptions in chat.** Reward redemptions from across the channel now show inline in chat. New toggles let you hide redemptions, polls, or predictions to keep things clean.
- **Recent searches.** The search bar remembers what you looked up, kept separately for Following, Discover, and Categories, so you can jump back with one click.
- **Drops completion at a glance.** Fully earned games show a DONE badge, and the title bar shows a check when you have finished a game's watch-time drops.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Region-blocked high qualities play reliably.** Higher tiers your region restricts (like 1440p) that use newer video formats no longer fail to load. They play automatically, with nothing to set up.
- **Special-event drops are farmable again.** Large event campaigns like EWC that list hundreds of channels were being silently hidden or dropped. Every eligible live channel now shows and earns correctly, on any of them, regardless of category.
- **Finished and reissued drop campaigns stop disappearing** from the drops panel, and now render as complete instead of vanishing.
- **Farming recovers when a stream ends.** If a farmed stream goes offline but keeps serving stale video, StreamNook notices the stall and switches channels or tells you, instead of hanging.
- **Chat history fills in on more channels** by finding the right log source, and a slow source no longer stalls the whole history card.
- **The profile history spinner no longer hangs.** It clears itself if the lookup wedges.

### ⚡ Performance
- **Categories loads faster.** Viewer counts load in parallel and sort correctly by viewers, so the grid fills in quickly.

### 🔧 Maintenance
- Joining a channel now seeds more recent chat history, so chat looks alive right away.

## [8.2.2] - 2026-07-08

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Improvements to region-based quality unlocking.** Refinements to how higher qualities are handled in regions where Twitch restricts them.

### 🤖 Also from us
Two free Discord bots for any server:
- **Cadence**, a full music bot you can run from your phone or the web, not just from chat commands. Everyone in the voice call can search, queue, and control playback from a single link, and you can connect Spotify to see your playlists and drop them straight into the queue.
- **Penrose**, an all-in-one moderation and community bot with deep, highly customizable controls: anti-nuke, moderation, automation, and per-server setups for nearly everything.

Both are completely free. Find them at [streamnook.app/bots](https://streamnook.app/bots).

## [8.2.1] - 2026-07-06

### ✨ Features
- **Watch in the qualities your region blocks.** Some streams offer higher resolutions like 1440p that Twitch restricts in certain countries. StreamNook now brings those options back automatically whenever they exist, with nothing for you to set up.
- **Full screen with F11.** A new borderless full-screen mode fills your entire display, over the taskbar, with the whole app: player, chat, and all. Toggle it from the title bar, the command palette, or the F11 key.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **A cleaner first run.** New installs no longer open to a pile of past announcements, and the announcement banner now waits until setup is finished before it appears.

## [8.2.0] - 2026-07-03

## 🎉 New: 250 Years of the Fourth of July
> Open StreamNook on the Fourth of July and the sky lights up with a full fireworks show for America's 250th birthday. Log in any time from July 3 to 5 to earn the limited Semiquincentennial badge, which unlocks the new Old Glory atmosphere for your profile and chat. On the Fourth you can replay the show all day from the title bar, and those who stay to watch may find a little something extra.

---

### ✨ Features
- **Mod Rooms.** Private, end-to-end encrypted chat rooms for the moderator teams of channels you moderate, with message editing, image attachments, typing indicators, and live member presence. A one-time consent confirms your moderator status without ever touching your main login.
- **Filter the directory by tags.** Browse a category and narrow the live streams by tags. Filtering happens at the source, so results reach past just the streams already loaded, and the tags on each stream tile are clickable.
- **Nova Ember atmosphere.** A flowing red, white, and blue aurora for your profile and chat, free for everyone who earns the Semiquincentennial badge.
- **Atmospheres library.** The cosmetics gallery (now called Global Cosmetics) has a StreamNook section split into Badges and Atmospheres. The Atmospheres view shows every theme and how to get it, whether it comes with a subscription, is earned with a badge, or is a hidden challenge waiting to be discovered. Opening someone's profile now also shows which atmosphere they are wearing.
- **Hype Trains, everywhere and instant.** The same Hype Train banner now appears across single chat, MultiChat panes, and the blended feed, and level-ups celebrate the moment they happen instead of seconds late.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Smoother video during a busy blended MultiChat feed. The merged feed now updates incrementally instead of rebuilding itself on every incoming message, so playback no longer stutters when chat is fast.

### 🔧 Maintenance
- Drops tooling now speaks in terms of "automation" and "collected" rather than "mining" and "farmed", a clearer name for what it actually does. Your existing settings and progress carry over automatically.

## [8.1.1] - 2026-06-25

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed Kick account sign-in. Connecting Kick to send messages and moderate now works as expected.

## [8.1.0] - 2026-06-25

## 🎉 New: Multi-platform chat, all in one window
> MultiChat is now a full multi-platform command center. Watch Twitch, Kick, YouTube, and TikTok chat side by side or in one blended feed, reply and moderate on Twitch, Kick, and YouTube, and track every sub, raid, gift, and super chat (including TikTok gifts) in a unified activity feed. Connect each account once and work your whole audience without leaving the window.

---

### ✨ Features
- **Multi-platform chat.** Add Kick, YouTube, and TikTok channels next to Twitch. View them as separate panes or one blended, time-ordered feed where each message shows the platform it came from.
- **Connect your accounts per platform.** Sign in to Kick and YouTube to send and moderate, all managed from one Account Connections screen.
- **Cross-platform moderation.** Ban, time out, and delete messages on Kick and YouTube as well as Twitch, with a combined moderator log across every source.
- **Activity feed.** A dedicated panel for subs, resubs, gift bombs, raids, YouTube super chats and members, Kick and TikTok gifts, and Twitch Hype Trains, with per-platform filters and a Super Chat currency converter.
- **Kick emotes in the picker.** Kick channel and global emotes appear alongside Twitch, BetterTTV, FFZ, and 7TV.
- **Go Live mode that frees memory.** Going live can close the main app to reclaim around 350MB, and opening a profile, badge, clip, or VOD brings it right back.
- **Watch VODs from a popout.** With the main app closed, VOD links in a chat popout now play in place.
- **Bigger, more readable chat.** Chat text scales up to 48px with badges and emotes scaling to match, and the activity feed has its own separate text size.
- **Watch-to-earn rewards.** Event rewards are claimed automatically for whatever you are watching, with a notification when you earn one.
- **Clearer points notifications.** Channel-points notifications now name the top channels and amounts instead of just a count.
- **Redesigned MultiChat settings.** A full-window settings panel with a category rail, search, and a quick theme picker.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed a freeze that could show "Not Responding" for several seconds when the window was covered by another window.
- The channel About panel now scrolls smoothly instead of snapping back to the stream when you scroll up.
- Drops and farming settings take effect immediately, and saving settings no longer overwrites the Autopilot plugin's farming configuration.
- Playback pauses during ad breaks no longer interrupt points and drops earning.
- Whispering from a popout profile card works even when the main app is closed.

### ⚡ Performance
- Windows load only the code they need, so chat-only popouts start faster and lighter.
- Removed a startup image preload that held roughly 120MB; backgrounds now load as they appear.

### 🔧 Maintenance
- Reworked the chat backend so every platform shares one message pipeline, keeping normal Twitch chat unchanged.

## [8.0.11] - 2026-06-22

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Channel points now span every channel you follow, not just the ones you watched this session. The Drops tab summary, the points leaderboard, and your profile all show your full holdings, with a refresh button to pull the latest on demand.
- Profile pictures show again across the channel points leaderboard, even when you follow a large number of channels.
- Channel points update the instant they change instead of waiting for the next watch-time tick.
- Drops claimed now matches the total Twitch shows, counting every award instead of collapsing repeats.
- Achievement badges tied to a running total stay earned once you hit the milestone, even if the live number later dips.
- Subscription tenure and estimated spend are now based on your full lifetime months subscribed to each channel rather than your current streak.
- Atmospheres you unlock as a subscriber stay yours, available even if your subscription later lapses.
- The drops button now offers a sign-in prompt after you fully sign out.

## [8.0.10] - 2026-06-21
### ✨ Features
- **Chat on the left, plus reveal on hover**: Dock chat on the left of the player, not just right or bottom. Side-docked chat can also tuck against its edge and slide out when you move toward it, with the player shrinking to make room.
- **Cinema Mode**: Choose how the letterbox bars around the video look. Cinema Mode keeps them classic black; off matches them to your theme background so the video appears to float.
- **Profile atmospheres update live**: When someone changes the atmosphere they're wearing while you're already in chat with them, it now updates for you on their next message instead of staying stuck on what they had before.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Dropdowns stay put**: Open settings dropdowns no longer close when you scroll or resize the window. They follow their button instead.

### 🔧 Maintenance
- **Cleaner mention highlights**: The mention and reply flash now uses a consistent accent color and drops the extra glow.
- **Sharper profile customization preview**: The chat preview now matches a real chat row's size, wrapping, and readability.

## [8.0.9] - 2026-06-21
### ✨ Features
- **CS2 Major Cologne 2026**: Watch any Counter-Strike stream in StreamNook within 24 hours of the Cologne grand finals to unlock a limited Cologne look for your chat and profile. Supporters can add the gold coin, subscribers can add the gold border too, and everyone in chat sees what you have applied.
- **Song recognition**: Tap the new music button on the player or type /song in chat, and StreamNook names the track playing in the stream, with cover art, artist, and one-tap links to Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, and more. No sign-in needed.
- **Reminders**: Have StreamNook auto-post a chat message on a repeating timer, after a delay, at a set time of day, once the stream hits a chosen uptime, or when a keyword appears in chat. Configure them in the new Reminders settings, or set one on the fly with a guided /remind.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Smoother playback during ads**: Fixed a live-playback glitch where the stream could replay or stutter the same moment during ad breaks, especially with the ad-bypass plugin.
- **No more freeze during login**: Fixed the app freezing or showing "Not Responding" when you alt-tab or minimize during Twitch login. Login, drops, and subscribe now open in a clean in-app window with a green padlock address bar.
- **Load more works on clips and videos**: Restored "Load more" on channel clip and video lists, and it no longer shows duplicate entries.
- **Accurate drop ownership**: Drop rewards are no longer wrongly marked as already earned when another reward in the same campaign shares its name.

### 🔧 Maintenance
- **Quieter, more findable**: Added a background watchdog that catches rare UI freezes so they can be diagnosed, and made the new settings searchable from settings search and the command palette.

## [8.0.8] - 2026-06-18
### 🔧 Maintenance
- **One-time sign-out after this update**: We did some behind-the-scenes maintenance on the login flow, cookie storage, and how your accounts are streamlined across all the activities you do. All you have to do is log back in, then sign in to Drops again.

## [8.0.7] - 2026-06-17
### ✨ Features
- **Your 7TV personal emotes work everywhere**: The personal emotes you set on 7TV now show up in every channel you watch, not just channels that happen to have added them. Like the 7TV browser extension, your personal set follows you from stream to stream.
- **Manage your personal emote set in the app**: The built-in 7TV emote manager now shows your personal emote set next to your channel sets, so you can add, remove, and rename your personal emotes without leaving StreamNook.
- **Three ways to open your emote manager**: Edit your emote sets from whichever spot is closest. A new gear in the emote picker opens it in one click, the command palette has "Open 7TV Emotes" (Ctrl+K), and the moderator menu opens it for any channel you moderate.

## [8.0.6] - 2026-06-16
### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Your chat color shows correctly right away**: Your own messages no longer flash a default color before snapping to your real one, and they no longer occasionally get stuck on the wrong color.
- **Low Latency is steadier under load**: Fixed the playback reload timeouts and refused connections that could cause stalls or buffering on the low-latency path.
- **Your live edge gap holds where you set it**: Low Latency now keeps your chosen delay more consistently instead of drifting too close to live, and moving the gap slider takes effect immediately while you watch instead of only after reloading the stream.
- **No more duplicate cards while browsing**: Loading more streams, clips, videos, or games in a category or the games grid no longer shows the same item twice.

## [8.0.5] - 2026-06-15
### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Experimental Low Latency plays cleanly on every channel**: On some streams, turning on experimental Low Latency could badly corrupt the picture and freeze playback. Video frames were being clipped short as the stream was repackaged for the low-latency path, so the decoder ran out of data partway down the frame. Frames now stay whole, and Low Latency holds up everywhere.
- **Following channels is more reliable**: Following and unfollowing now goes through your signed-in session directly, with no hidden background window needed to make it work.
- **Chat colors and badges fill in reliably**: When someone's name color or badges briefly failed to load, they could stay blank for the rest of the session. They now fill in on that person's next message instead.

### 🔧 Maintenance
- **One more sign-in after this update**: To finish moving following onto the more reliable path, this update signs you out once so everything reconnects cleanly. Just sign back in when prompted.

## [8.0.4] - 2026-06-15
### ✨ Features
- **First-run setup, expanded**: The setup wizard now walks you through picking a theme, choosing your sidebar style, and setting how you get notified, each with a live preview, so the app feels like yours before you start watching.
- **Remembers where you left it**: StreamNook now reopens at the same size and position on screen, so you no longer have to resize or move the window every launch.
- **Whisper history that stays in sync**: A new refresh button pulls your latest whisper messages straight from Twitch, so replies you sent from the website or your phone show up in StreamNook without losing anything you already had.
- **A live edge gap you control**: A new slider lets you dial exactly how close to live you want to ride, from a near-live feel to rock-solid playback, replacing the old all-or-nothing toggle. An opt-in Low Latency engine is there too for the tightest experience on channels that support it.
- **Drops and Channel Points sign-in, made obvious**: When drops and points need their own Twitch sign-in, the gift button in the title bar now clearly shows a Login prompt, and signing in reuses your existing Twitch session so you just approve instead of logging in all over again.
- **Natural live notifications**: Go-live alerts now read naturally for non-gaming streams, saying things like "Just chatting" or "Making music" instead of "Playing Just Chatting".
- **Plugin settings, all in one place**: Plugins can now add their own panels to the Integrations settings and link you straight to them, so connected apps and services live together in a consistent spot.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Account switching respects the account you picked**: Switching between linked accounts now correctly uses the one you selected, for your session, ad-free status (Turbo or a channel sub), badges, and following channels, so an alt no longer inherits another account's perks or leaks the previous session. Signing out fully resets the old account and stops it from earning drops or points.
- **Whispers stay private to each account**: Your whisper history is now tied to the account you are signed in with, so switching accounts or signing out no longer surfaces another account's messages.
- **Your look loads instantly**: Your paint, badges, atmosphere, and profile card now appear the moment chat or your profile opens after a restart, instead of popping in a beat later, and a brief hiccup talking to the cosmetics service no longer strips them away.
- **No more signed-out flash on launch**: Opening the app now shows a clean loading screen while it confirms your saved login, instead of briefly flashing a signed-out home.
- **Chat keeps flowing when the window is hidden**: Chat now keeps updating reliably even when the window is minimized, occluded, or moving in and out of fullscreen, instead of freezing until you refresh.
- **Signing in is more reliable**: The Twitch login code you approve is now always the one the app is waiting on, so logins no longer get stuck, and everything that needs your account works right after you sign in without a restart.
- **Drop progress you can trust**: The drops progress badge no longer sticks at 0% on streams where you already own the reward, and drop watch time keeps crediting reliably even after the connection sits idle.
- **An honest behind-live readout**: The "behind live" number in the stream stats overlay now lines up with what Twitch itself reports, instead of overstating how far behind you are.
- **Steadier standard playback**: Streams on the standard path now play on a single stable connection, removing a class of stalls and drift some channels saw over a long session.
- **More reliable auto-switch**: When a stream you are watching goes offline, StreamNook now finds another stream in the same category more accurately.

### 🔧 Maintenance
- **Default-on conveniences**: The bonus chest is now auto-claimed on the stream you are watching, and the video keeps its aspect ratio out of the box, so these work without you turning them on.
- **Interface polish**: A roomier title bar, a cleaner collapsed sidebar, tidier settings groupings, and a consistent live-red that stays the same across every theme.
- **Consistent badge order**: Your badges now appear in the same order everywhere, with your StreamNook badge leading, so chat and profile cards always match.

## [8.0.3] - 2026-06-14
### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed drops progress showing the wrong reward: watching a channel on a drop's allow-list while it streamed a different game would display and count that drop's progress even though you weren't earning it.
- Fixed the drops channel picker offering channels you can't earn on. It was listing offline channels, and for channel-restricted drops it listed participating channels that weren't currently streaming the campaign's game.

## [8.0.2] - 2026-06-14
### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Drops campaigns that only run on specific channels now offer a channel picker, so you can choose a participating live channel straight from the campaign and start watching.
- Drop rewards now show a clear Badge, Emote, or Item label, so you can tell at a glance what each reward actually is.
- The stream stats panel can now be dragged anywhere over the player, and it remembers where you left it.
- Event and special-event drops now track progress correctly when you watch a participating channel, even when that channel's category doesn't match the campaign.
- Earned badges now count toward a campaign's "earned" tally consistently, instead of sometimes reading zero while the badge sits claimed in your collection.
- The post-update changelog popup now opens on the version you just installed, instead of occasionally sticking on an older release from a stale cache.
- The frosted glass on pop-up dialogs now follows your Glassiness setting, going fully solid at the lowest setting like the rest of the app.

## [8.0.1] - 2026-06-13
### 🔧 Maintenance
- **Update checks are downgrade-safe**: The built-in updater now compares versions properly and only offers a newer build, so a momentary hiccup in the update service can never prompt you to "update" to an older version.

## [8.0.0] - 2026-06-14
## 🎉 New: A built-in Marketplace, and StreamNook is now modular
> The features you know no longer all live in one binary. StreamNook 8.0 introduces a real plugin system with a Marketplace built right in: familiar add-ons that used to be part of the core app now ship as opt-in plugins you install in one click, so the app stays lean and you run only what you want. Best of all it is open. The community can build and submit their own plugins, so what is available keeps growing beyond the ones we make.

---

### ✨ What's new
- **The Marketplace**: Open the Store icon in the title bar to browse a curated catalog of plugins, see exactly what each one does, and install or update in one click. It is built in, so there is nothing to set up.
- **Community plugins**: The plugin system is open. Anyone can build a plugin and submit it for the Marketplace, so the catalog grows beyond what we ship, and each plugin's settings appear right where they belong in the app.
- **Update notifications**: When an installed plugin has a newer version, the Store icon shows a count and each plugin gets an Update button in the Installed tab.

### 🧩 Familiar features, now opt-in plugins
> These were already part of StreamNook. They work the same, they are just plugins now, so you install only the ones you use. Updating from an older version? Open the Store icon and add the ones you used to bring them right back.
- **Autopilot**: Background Drops and channel-points farming without keeping a stream open, plus a Mine button on every Drops card to farm a reward without watching it.
- **Ad-Free Playback**: Ad-free live viewing resolved through community playlist proxies, with a built-in proxy health checker.
- **Lists**: Your go-to text (usernames, commands, links) in a floating, pop-out panel that docks into mod logs, with a command-palette entry and a hotkey.

### ⚡ Low latency, tuned to match Twitch
> The streaming backend got a deep refactor. Playback now holds latency on par with Twitch's own player, and on channels that have low latency enabled you stay just a couple of seconds behind the broadcaster, in the solo player and in every Multi-Nook tile. New low-latency diagnostics and codec-aware resolution selection keep playback on the best stream and close to live, without the drift that creeps in over a long session.

### 🎨 Interface
> A wave of interface work across the app: the new Marketplace's clean app-store layout, clearer plugin badges (Official, Approved, and Installed), and polish throughout the UI.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Chat connections stay healthy**: Reworked how chat rooms are claimed so a closed tab or a reconnect can no longer pin a room and leave it stuck.
- **Drops progress is accurate and steady**: The title-bar and overlay progress now show the reward you are actually on, including the right tier in a multi-reward campaign, and hold steady instead of flickering.

## [7.8.7] - 2026-06-12
### 🔧 Maintenance
- **StreamNook is moving to its own GitHub organization**: The project is getting a proper home at github.com/StreamNook instead of living under a personal account. This update teaches the built-in updater to follow the project to its new address, so install it to keep receiving future releases automatically.

## [7.8.6] - 2026-06-10
## 🎉 New: Low latency playback, rebuilt to ride seconds behind live
> StreamNook now picks up video in small pieces as the broadcaster encodes them, instead of waiting for whole segments to finish. On channels with low latency enabled, that puts you roughly two to three seconds behind the broadcaster, in the solo player and in every Multi-Nook tile. Channels without low latency keep playing exactly as before.

---

### ✨ Features
- **Lists, a home for your go-to text**: Create as many lists as you like for usernames, commands, links, or anything else you keep reaching for. Click an entry to copy it, hover to send it into chat, and paste a whole batch at once (one per line, comma separated, or straight from a spreadsheet). The panel floats over the app without blocking chat, pops out into its own pinnable window, and can dock right into the mod logs view. Open it from the title bar, the command palette, or Ctrl+Shift+L.
- **A latency readout you can trust**: The stream stats overlay now shows your true delay to the broadcaster (the same number Twitch reports) plus your configured buffer target, so you can tell at a glance whether you are actually behind.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Low latency no longer freezes on refresh**: Upcoming segments promoted into the playlist could change identity between updates, which could crash playback mid-stream. Their numbering and addresses now stay stable from one update to the next.
- **Go Live lands where it should**: The button now jumps only to video that is actually ready to play, and if the stream has genuinely stalled it restarts playback instead of seeking somewhere unplayable.
- **Quieter quality switches**: Changing quality or restarting a stream no longer lets the outgoing player surface errors while the new one spins up.

### ⚡ Performance
- **Stays close to live on every channel**: On channels without low latency, playback now speeds up almost imperceptibly whenever you drift past your buffer target, so delay no longer creeps up over a long session.
- **Faster grid cold starts**: Multi-Nook tiles now start up in parallel when you load a full preset, instead of waiting on each other.

## [7.8.5] - 2026-06-07
### ✨ Features
- **Spotlight a stream in Multi-Nook**: Double-click any tile (or use the new spotlight button) to fill the whole grid with that one stream, then double-click again or press Esc to drop back to the grid. Spotlighting also moves audio and chat to that stream, so it behaves just like the solo player, and the other streams keep running in the background for an instant switch back.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Channel emotes no longer drop to plain text**: The emote prefetch added in 7.8.3 could leave a channel's emotes showing as plain words when 7TV was slow or down. Each channel's emote list is now saved locally and loaded the instant you open chat, a failed or partial 7TV fetch can no longer overwrite a good saved list, and your emotes survive restarts.
- **No more freezes in low-latency mode**: The player was riding too close to the live edge, so a normal gap in Twitch's segment delivery could drain the buffer and stall playback. It now keeps a bit more cushion, and Multi-Nook tiles use a steadier buffer, so streams play smoothly without stalling.

## [7.8.4] - 2026-06-06
## 🎉 New: Save and reload your multi-stream layouts with Grid Presets
> Build the perfect multi-stream grid once, then save it as a named preset and bring it back any time with a single click. Swap between your favorite lineups, drop a preset on top of what you are already watching, and give each one a custom icon from game art or a channel avatar. Searching for channels to add now works right inside the preset editor too.

---

### ✨ Features
- **Friendlier offline tiles**: When a channel is offline or cannot load, its tile now shows a clear status with one-tap Retry and Hide buttons instead of spinning forever.
- **Per-tile quality that sticks**: The stream quality you choose for a tile in multi-view is now remembered across restarts and saved with your backups.
- **Instant unlock celebrations**: The moment a Subscriber or Supporter badge purchase comes through, a gentle notification slides in to confirm it, with no restart needed.
- **Clickable member badges**: Tap someone's StreamNook number badge on their profile card to open their public profile, even from a popped-out window.
- **Favorites get their own section**: Favorited channels now sit in a dedicated section above Followed, and you can hide the Recommended section entirely from Interface settings.
- **One-tap reload**: The player refresh button, and a new /reload chat command, now reload the video and reconnect chat together in a single action.
- **Twitch-first emote search**: Typing a colon, like :PogU, now surfaces Twitch and sub emotes ahead of third-party sets.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Smoother multi-stream startup**: Tiles now wait for a small buffer cushion before playing, so cold-starting several streams at once no longer stalls right after they load.
- **One offline channel no longer drags down the grid**: A tile that cannot go live stops retrying in the background, keeping the rest of your streams responsive.
- **Login and popup windows restored**: 7TV login, automation, and chat-identity windows open reliably again.
- **Up-to-date 7TV sign-in**: Logging in to 7TV now uses the current flow that actually issues a token.
- **Cosmetics update right away**: Changing your badge or paint now repaints your chat row and profile card immediately instead of waiting up to a minute.
- **Missed unlocks catch up on their own**: Badges or perks granted while you were away now appear when you return to the app or reconnect, without a restart.
- **Fullscreen tiles come to the front**: Fullscreening a tile in the grid now lifts it cleanly above the other tiles.
- **Changelog dates show the right day**: Date-only entries no longer appear a day early in time zones behind UTC.
- **No more doubled badge**: Members without an equipped cosmetic now show a single default badge instead of two.

### 🔧 Maintenance
- **Refined title-bar pill**: The notification pill sits more cleanly in the title bar with a subtler unread indicator.
- **Consistent sidebar glass**: The floating sidebar now follows your Glassiness setting like every other glass surface.

## [7.8.3] - 2026-06-05
### ✨ Features
- **Audio Boost**: Make stream audio louder and more even. A built-in compressor evens out quiet talking and loud moments and lifts overall loudness past the source without the harsh distortion of cranking volume past max. Turn it on from the player control bar or Player settings, fine-tune it with on-screen sliders right over the video, and reset to defaults anytime. Off until you enable it.
- **Emote Prefetch**: Bulk-download the emotes from every channel you follow in one background pass, ideally while you are away. Once it finishes, chat and the emote menu fill in instantly with nothing left to fetch, and it takes load off 7TV. Start, watch progress, or stop it from Cache settings.
- **Place Notifications Anywhere**: Pick which corner or edge your popup notifications appear in with a simple visual picker, and use a spacing slider to lift them off the screen edge so they do not sit on top of chat.
- **Fully Flat Glass**: The Glassiness slider now goes all the way to a completely solid, blur-free interface for anyone who does not want any frosted-glass effect, not just slightly more opaque panels.
- **Jump Straight to a Setting**: Settings can now open directly to a specific section and scroll right to it, instead of dropping you on a tab to hunt for the option.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Chat no longer goes blank when you join**: A slow or down 7TV could leave chat empty for several seconds on join. Recent messages now backfill immediately while emotes load in the background, and a circuit breaker stops a 7TV outage from stalling the whole connection.
- **Emotes recover on their own during a 7TV outage**: When 7TV returns an empty set, the app no longer caches that gap for the rest of your session. It quietly re-fetches once 7TV is healthy again, so you do not have to refresh manually.
- **Animated FrankerFaceZ emotes actually animate**: Animated FFZ emotes were being shown as still images. They now play.
- **Emotes and badges render reliably**: Cached images are now saved in their true format and keyed per provider, so they no longer collide or show up broken. Existing miscached emotes are repaired automatically on launch.
- **Consistent drops progress everywhere**: The title-bar drops badge, the game cards, and the detailed drops panel now read from the same live source, so progress updates promptly and matches across all three instead of drifting apart.
- **Readable announcement banners**: In-app announcement banners are now solid and legible at any Glassiness setting, including fully transparent.
- **Steadier low-latency playback**: Hardened a low-latency code path that could freeze playback on certain streams.

### ⚡ Performance
- **Smoother, faster chat**: Busy channels scroll and animate far more smoothly, the emote picker opens faster and uses less memory over long sessions, and joining a channel does less work up front.

### 🔧 Maintenance
- The Cache settings panel now reports what is actually stored, clears everything in one click, and adds a button to open the cache folder.

## [7.8.2] - 2026-06-05
### ✨ Features
- **True Low-Latency Streaming**: Experience minimal delay with an actively managed HLS pipeline, featuring dynamic target duration adjustments and Twitch PREFETCH segment promotion, allowing your player to ride closer to the live edge than ever before.
- **Third-Party Chat Badges for Everyone**: Enjoy a richer chat experience as StreamNook now displays BTTV, FFZ, Chatterino, and other third-party badges for *all* chatters, not just StreamNook members. Badge resolution is now significantly more efficient.
- **Reimagined Profile & Live Preview**: Your public StreamNook profile has a stunning new design. Track how many times your profile is viewed, customize which sections are visible to others, and use the new 'Live Preview' in settings to see your edits in real-time.
- **Real-Time Stream Stats**: A new overlay provides vital diagnostics like latency to live, resolution, FPS, bitrate, and buffer status. Easily jump to the absolute live edge with the 'Go Live' button.
- **Global Motion Control**: Tailor StreamNook's animations to your preference with new settings: 'Full' for all fluid transitions, 'Reduced' for fades only (easier on the eyes and lighter on slower PCs), or 'Off' for an instant, snappy interface.
- **Full-Page Settings Window**: Configure StreamNook with more room! The settings dialog can now expand to a full-page layout, providing ample space for extensive customization.
- **Smoother UI Transitions**: Enjoy a more polished experience with new, fluid animations for opening and closing overlays, modals, and dropdown menus.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Accurate Drops Mining Completion**: Fixed issues where drops campaigns would sometimes continue mining indefinitely or display incorrect progress after completion. We now precisely identify when all drops are claimed and properly shut down background tasks.
- **Reliable Stream Information**: Resolved an issue where stream titles and game categories could appear blank after raid redirects, ensuring your UI and Discord Rich Presence always show the correct details.
- **YouTube Link Previews**: Corrected an issue preventing link previews from loading for some YouTube channel pages.
- **Chat Moderation Overlay**: The moderation drag layer no longer overlaps messages, ensuring clear visibility.

### 🔧 Maintenance
- Refined and updated the visual style of various settings and profile display components for a more cohesive 'glass-tile' aesthetic.

## [7.8.1] - 2026-06-04
## 🧰 New: Manage Your 7TV Emotes Inside StreamNook
> Connect your 7TV account and run your emotes entirely from the app. Add, rename, remove, and organize emotes across every channel you can edit, manage your emote sets, and add or remove editors, all without opening a browser. This release also reworks chat moderation with a drag-to-moderate gesture and real channel-wide message pinning, and lets you back up your entire setup to a single file and restore it on any machine.

---

### ✨ Features
- **7TV Emote Manager**: A full 7TV workspace built into StreamNook, covering your own channel and every channel you're an editor of.
  - Browse and search the entire 7TV directory with sort (Trending, Top, Newest) and filters (Animated, Zero-width, Exact match), or add an emote by pasting its 7tv.app link.
  - Add emotes under a custom name and as a zero-width overlay, then rename, re-toggle, or remove them later.
  - Open an emote's detail card for large previews, tags, flags, and how many channels use it.
  - Create, rename, resize, and switch your active emote set, with a live capacity meter.
  - Manage editors: invite by username, grant or revoke per-area permissions, and accept or decline editor invites from other channels.
  - Quick-add: left-click any 7TV emote in chat to drop it into a set you edit. Open the manager from the command palette or the moderator menu.
- **Reworked Chat Moderation**:
  - **Drag to moderate**: grab any message and drag it onto a floating dock of action buckets (Delete, Timeout, Ban, plus Unban and Untimeout for already-moderated users). Buckets snap magnetically, so no pixel-perfect aim is needed.
  - **Dial timeouts by feel**: drag further from the Timeout bucket to set a longer duration, from 5 seconds up to Twitch's 14-day max, with a live duration label.
  - **Undo**: ban and timeout confirmations include an Undo button.
  - **Pin messages**: mods can pin any message in one click. Pins use Twitch's real pin system, so they appear for every viewer on every client, not just locally. A collapsed pin bar keeps it one line tall until you expand it.
- **Settings Backup & Restore**: Export every preference (themes, chat design, keybindings, highlights, custom commands, moderation, integrations, and more) to a single file, then import it on any machine. Your Twitch login is never included, so backups are safe to move around.
- **Search Your Settings**: A search box in Settings matches across every tab and jumps you straight to the matching section.
- **Styled Chat Usernames**: New options for how names render in chat, including a separator glyph between name and message and several name styles (accent bar, frosted chip, brackets, and more), with a live preview in settings.
- **Expanded Link Previews**: Rich cards now cover Discord invites (server icon, live online and member counts, Join button), Steam store pages (art, description, and current price), Spotify tracks and albums, Instagram profiles, and Tenor GIFs. A new shield button lets you permanently trust a domain so its links always expand.
- **Customizable Player Buttons**: Choose which action buttons appear over the video (Follow, Subscribe, Create Clip, Clips & VODs, Add to MultiNook, Refresh, Close).
- **Channel About, on Scroll**: Scroll down over the player to reveal a Twitch-style About panel with the streamer's panels, social links, and quick actions. The stream keeps playing the whole time, and social links render as rich preview cards.
- **Color-Customizable OLED Theme**: The OLED theme now takes any accent color, with eight one-click presets. Existing OLED users keep their current look.
- **Image-Based Atmospheres**: Premium Atmospheres can now be animated image backdrops, with a portrait mode for the profile panel and a readability frost behind chat. Atmospheres can also be earned through accolades, not just subscriptions, and new ones can arrive without an app update.
- **Animated 7TV Profile Pictures**: Animated 7TV avatars now display on user cards.
- **7TV Paint Usage Stats**: Sort paints by Most Used or Least Used, and see how many people wear a given paint.
- **Redesigned Community & Integrations Tabs**: The Support and Integrations settings are now Discord-style cards with live server stats and a one-click join.
- **Drops: How to Unlock**: Locked campaign rewards now show a tooltip explaining what they require (sub, gift sub, Prime, bits, or follow).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Streams that wouldn't load now play**: Twitch rolled out a new stream playlist format that the old parser read as having zero qualities, so some channels simply wouldn't start. The parser now handles both the old and new formats.
- **Settings now stick between restarts**: A range of preferences (chat design, emote sizing, link-preview options, highlight phrases, custom commands, moderation preferences, custom themes, and the OLED accent color) were silently dropped on save and reset every launch. They now persist, including when loaded from older settings files.
- **Clips that wrongly said "not found" now open**: Clip lookups no longer break when Twitch rotates an internal query ID, and real errors are surfaced instead of masked.
- **Steadier ad-free playback**: When an ad-block proxy answers with an error page that still reports success, the app now treats it as a miss, races to another proxy, and falls back to the standard stream rather than failing outright.
- **Drops progress tracks the right drop**: Mining now follows the unclaimed drop closest to completion instead of pinning to an already-finished one, and claiming a drop no longer snaps the title-bar progress backward.
- **Mine any campaign you pick**: You can now preview and mine a manually chosen campaign even if it isn't in your priority list.
- **Badge sorting**: Badge entries missing usage stats are re-fetched so Most and Least Used sort correctly, and Available Now / Coming Soon now filter the list instead of just reordering it.
- **Reliable profiles for localized names**: Profile banners and extended profile data now resolve for users whose display name differs from their login, and profile actions (whisper, gift sub, mod commands) always target the correct account.
- **No more blank page after search**: Leaving a stream you opened from search returns you to where you were instead of an empty results page.
- **Overlays no longer cover the Dynamic Island or the drops hover preview.**

### ⚡ Performance
- **Instant profile cards**: Profiles open immediately from a cached snapshot and refresh in the background, so banners and backdrops no longer appear a beat late.
- **Smoother sidebar**: The compact sidebar's glass blur now settles after it finishes expanding, removing the choppy redraw during the animation.

### 🔧 Maintenance
- Cleaned decorative emoji out of internal logs and the proxy-health panel for clearer output.
- Renamed several built-in themes for clarity. Your current selection is preserved.

## [7.8.0] - 2026-06-03
## 🎬 New: Twitch Clip Creation & Advanced Streamer Profiles
> We've completely overhauled how you interact with Twitch clips and streamer profiles!

### ✨ Features
- **Twitch Clip Creation**: Create clips from live streams, or trim and title clips from VODs with an intuitive in-app editor. Share your creations to chat or copy the link to share anywhere.
- **Clip Playback & Management**: Play Twitch clips directly within StreamNook via a new modal player. Copy links, open in browser, or delete clips you own. New clips now show total reactions (likes, etc.) from other viewers.

  - **Message Recall**: Type a message, press `ArrowUp` to recall previously sent messages (Chatterino-style!), and `ArrowDown` to navigate forward or restore your current draft.
- **Richer Link Previews**: Twitch clips, VODs, and YouTube channel links now expand into beautiful, info-rich preview cards directly in chat.
- **Discord Rich Presence Overhaul**: Your Discord status is now more dynamic, showing proper category art (even for 'Just Chatting' or 'Music'), personalizing idle messages with your username, and resetting the 'watching for' timer more intelligently.

- **Quick Sign Out**: Access a convenient 'Sign out' button directly from the Profile tab in Settings, with a quick confirmation step.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where watch time and stream counts for analytics were inaccurate due to how stream URLs changed during ads or quality switches.
- Resolved a problem where re-authenticating after Twitch scope changes could leave your account in a broken state. The app now performs a full, clean re-authentication when necessary.
- Fixed an issue where clicking on links in chat could open multiple browser tabs by removing redundant `target="_blank"` attributes.
- Corrected an issue where stream lists would sometimes incorrectly filter historical clips, especially for 'last 30 days'.
- Addressed a rare startup issue where the universal cache flush task could fail before the app's core services were ready.

### ⚡ Performance

- **Faster Link Previews**: Generic link previews now load much quicker by intelligently fetching only the essential parts of a webpage.
- **Optimized Emote Display**: Improved loading and caching for 7TV emotes ensures they display faster and more reliably, even with multiple resolution tiers.

## 🎉 New: Inline Link Previews in Chat
> Sharing a link in chat just got a whole lot more engaging! StreamNook now automatically generates rich, interactive previews for YouTube videos, X/Twitter posts and profiles, Giphy GIFs, and most other webpages. See titles, descriptions, and thumbnails directly in your chat, making conversations smoother and more informative.

---

### ✨ Features
- **Inline Link Previews**: Supported links now display rich cards in chat with titles, descriptions, and thumbnails for a variety of services including YouTube, X (Twitter), Giphy, and general webpages.

### 🔧 Maintenance
- Various performance improvements, notably in high-speed-chat streams.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Improved Fullscreen Experience**: Fullscreen mode now works seamlessly across both single-stream and MultiNook views, ensuring the entire display is covered (including the taskbar) and your layout is correctly restored upon exit.

### 🔧 Maintenance
- Updated internal Supabase tools.

## [7.7.0] - 2026-06-02
## 🚀 Native Streaming is Here
> StreamNook now directly plays Twitch streams without needing Streamlink or the TTVLOL plugin. Enjoy faster startup times, a smaller app footprint, and more reliable ad-free viewing, all handled seamlessly within the app. This is a foundational rewrite of how StreamNook connects to Twitch.

---

### ✨ Features
- **Native Stream Playback**: Faster startup, reduced memory usage, and a completely self-contained app. No more external installations or troubleshooting for Streamlink.
- **Proactive Ad-Block Pivoting**: If an ad-block proxy region starts leaking ads, StreamNook will automatically switch to a different, healthy region and reload the stream, ensuring continuous ad-free viewing.
- **Intelligent Drops Mining**: The automated drops miner now intelligently tracks your closest-to-completion drop in the current game, ensuring you always see the most relevant progress.
- **Robust Mining Recovery**: The drops miner can now detect if a streamer goes offline, switches games, or if your progress stalls. It will automatically switch to another eligible channel or temporarily blacklist problematic streamers, preventing wasted watch time.
- **View Your Subscriptions**: New section to see your active and past Twitch channel subscriptions.

### 🔧 Maintenance
- **Smaller App, Faster Updates**: The app bundle size has been significantly reduced, making downloads faster and updates more reliable. Existing users will also see disk space reclaimed from old bundled components.

## ✨ Revamped: Account Switching & Identity Management
> Now you can effortlessly switch between your Twitch accounts directly within StreamNook! Manage which account you watch and stream as, and easily switch the identity you send chat messages from.
