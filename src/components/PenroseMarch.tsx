/**
 * The StreamNook mark: nine isometric cubes forming a Penrose impossible
 * triangle, with each cube marching one slot around the perimeter on a 1.5s
 * loop.
 *
 * This is a faithful port of `scripts/penrose-source.html`, the same source the
 * gold subscriber badge and the five tenure badges are baked from. Geometry,
 * document order and the cube 8 hand-off are copied from it verbatim. Only two
 * things differ, and neither touches the drawing:
 *
 *   1. Face colours come from the theme accent instead of being gold.
 *   2. The viewBox is padded, because the source's box leaves under two units of
 *      margin and reads as clipped once the cubes march.
 *
 * Do not "improve" the stacking. The order is hand-tuned, several pairs of cubes
 * are deliberately drawn in the wrong depth order, and that is exactly what makes
 * the triangle read as impossible. A consistent depth sort turns it into an
 * ordinary pile of blocks, and partial corrections make panels appear to lie
 * across cubes they should be behind.
 *
 * The one thing added on top is the seam strips. The three faces share exact
 * edges and each is antialiased separately, so those shared edges come out
 * slightly translucent and whatever sits behind shows through as a hairline.
 * Each internal seam therefore gets a narrow strip drawn directly beneath it,
 * painted with the SAME GRADIENT as the darker of its two faces, so the line
 * renders as a crisp continuation of that face instead of a third colour.
 * That is why the gradients are defined in cube-local user space rather than
 * per-shape bounding boxes: the strip must sample identical colours to the
 * face it impersonates.
 *
 * Approaches already tried and rejected, so they do not come back:
 * - Stroking the faces: a stroke grows outward and bleeds onto the next cube.
 * - A full-size opaque hexagon underneath: its own antialiased edge fattens
 *   the silhouette by a part pixel, a light rim that breathes as cubes move.
 * - An inset hexagon in one mid tone: the seam then reads LIGHT against the
 *   dark left face and DARK against the light top face, a half-and-half line.
 *   And for the split cubes it rode with the bottom-pinned face, so other
 *   cubes slid between it and the seam mid-loop and showed through the gap.
 *
 * Strip placement for the split cubes is deliberate, per seam: each strip
 * lives in the group where nothing that matters can interpose between it and
 * the two faces it backs. Worked out case by case; see the body comments.
 *
 * The rule this file has already had to learn several times: changes here are
 * judged by eye, never by counting changed pixels.
