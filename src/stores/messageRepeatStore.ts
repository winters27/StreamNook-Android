/**
 * Repeat runs, keyed by the id of the FIRST message in the run.
 *
 * When repeat collapse is on, chatConnectionStore keeps only that first message
 * in chat and routes every later copy here. The surviving row subscribes via
 * `useMessageRepeat` and renders the count, so a copypasta wave shows as one row
 * with "x30" instead of 30 identical rows.
 *
 * This mirrors giftBombStore deliberately. Keeping the count in a side store and
 * subscribing from inside the row is what lets an already-mounted ChatMessage
 * update without new props: React.memo only gates re-renders driven by the
 * parent, not by a component's own hook subscriptions. Threading a count prop
 * through ChatMessageList would re-render the whole list instead.
