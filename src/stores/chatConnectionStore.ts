// Per-channel Twitch chat state, owned by a single shared WebSocket bridge to
// the Rust IRC service. Multiple consumers (the main app's ChatWidget plus N
// MultiChat tab widgets) acquire channels through this store; the store
// reference-counts subscribers so we hold exactly one IRC connection regardless
// of how many UI surfaces are viewing the same channel.
//
// Wire-format contract with the Rust backend (`src-tauri/src/services/irc_service.rs`):
//   • Native IRC frames (PRIVMSG / USERNOTICE / etc.) carry `#channel` in their
//     own text and are routed here by inspecting that substring.
//   • Synthetic events `USER_BADGES:#<channel>:<badges>`,
//     `{"type":"ROOMSTATE","channel":…}`, `{"type":"CLEARMSG","channel":…}`,
//     `{"type":"CLEARCHAT","channel":…}` carry the channel explicitly.
//   • Global events `HEARTBEAT`, `IRC_CONNECTED`, `RECONNECTING:n`,
//     `RECONNECTED`, `RECONNECT_*`, `CONNECTION_WARNING:…` are not channel-
//     scoped and apply to every active channel slice.
//
// Channel keys are stored lowercase — IRC frames always carry lowercase, so
// upstream callers using mixed case still resolve correctly via `.toLowerCase()`
// at the API boundary.
