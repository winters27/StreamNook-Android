// Background/foreground lifecycle for the mobile shell.
//
// A phone spends most of its time with the app backgrounded, and Android
// throttles WebView timers there rather than stopping them: the badge-drop
// socket keeps pinging, Supabase realtime holds its socket, and hls.js keeps
// pulling segments for a stream nobody is watching. That is battery and data
// spent on nothing, and on resume the backlogged timers all fire at once.
//
// So: stand the background chatter down when hidden and bring it back on
// resume. The one deliberate exception is picture-in-picture, where the app is
// reported hidden but is still very much on screen.
//
// Playback is deliberately NOT touched. Backgrounding a stream to keep
// listening is a normal thing to do with a Twitch client, and pausing the video
// (or calling hls stopLoad, which stalls it once the buffer drains) would take
// that away. The sockets are pure background chatter with no user-visible
// value while hidden; the audio is not.
