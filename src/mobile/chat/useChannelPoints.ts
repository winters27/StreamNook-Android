// Channel points: the balance, the channel's own points branding, the bonus
// chest, and the credit feed the composer animates.
//
// `get_channel_points_for_channel` runs on the drops token, so this quietly
// yields nothing until the drops account is connected. That is the right
// failure mode: the composer just does not show a points button rather than
// showing a broken one.
//
// The response nests under either `data.community.channel` or
// `data.user.channel` depending on which web client answered, so both are
// accepted, same rule the desktop composer uses.
//
// Two things this has to do that are not obvious.
//
// The bonus chest is collected by the FRONTEND, not by Rust. There is no
// backend poller and no backend auto-claim for the channel you are watching;
// the drops service says so outright, and the only background sweep lives in
// the automation plugin, which does not run here. So if this hook does not
// claim the chest, nothing does, and every chest on the phone expires.
//
// Passive per-minute points DO get credited already, by the Rust watch
// heartbeat, but nothing announces them. There is no event and no push. The
// only way to see that earning is happening is to ask again and compare, which
// is what the poll below is for: the difference between two reads is the credit
// that just landed.
