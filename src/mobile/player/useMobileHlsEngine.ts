// Standalone hls.js engine for the mobile player. Deliberately NOT extracted
// from VideoPlayer.tsx: the desktop createPlayer interleaves Plyr construction
// and window orchestration that took months to settle; this is the lean subset
// a phone needs. The latency handling below is a faithful copy of the desktop's
// rather than a shared module, for the same reason.
//
// Three pieces work together and none of them does anything alone.
//
// The PROBE decides which path this stream is on. Low latency is a per-stream
// fact, not a preference: the setting arms the backend, and the backend only
// serves the low-latency origin when the channel actually supports it. Asking
// is the only way to know, and it has to happen before the player is built,
// because hls.js can only be told at construction.
//
// The BUFFER GATE decides where playback starts. Without it the cold-start
// buffer, not the configured cushion, sets how far behind live you sit: the
// buffer accumulates behind an advancing edge, so playback begins wherever that
// pile started and stays there. Snapping to the freshest buffered moment minus
// the cushion is what makes the setting mean anything.
//
// The GOVERNOR keeps it there. hls.js's own catch-up is switched off (its rate
// steps are coarse enough to hear), so without something holding the playhead
// it drifts further behind across a session. It only ever nudges playbackRate,
// never seeks; seeking a live stream toward the edge mid-playback freezes it.
//
// Before these landed the phone had none of the three, which is why the Low
// Latency setting appeared to do nothing at all: the backend was serving the
// right thing and the player was ignoring it.

// The earning gate.
//
// The Rust watch heartbeat credits a minute-watched (drops progress + channel
// points) only while the player says it is playing, and it samples that flag
// INSTANTANEOUSLY once every 60 seconds. A two-second window where the flag
// reads false can therefore cost a whole minute, which is why this mirrors the
// desktop VideoPlayer's handlers rather than reporting every state the media
// element passes through.
//
// Desktop rules, ported from VideoPlayer.tsx:
//   - `playing` reports true at once and cancels any pending paused report.
//   - `pause` does NOT report false. It arms a grace timer, and only a pause
//     that outlives the timer reports false.
//   - There is no `waiting` handler. A buffer underrun is not a pause. Phones
//     underrun constantly, and reporting false on each one is the whole reason
//     earning was spotty here while the desktop was flawless.
//   - Teardown cancels the pending report and reports nothing. Desktop does
//     exactly this in an unmount effect, for the reason its comment gives: a
//     report that lands after the player is gone gates the NEXT stream off.
//

// useMobileHlsEngine call site, in one MobilePlayer, in one WatchScreen. If a
