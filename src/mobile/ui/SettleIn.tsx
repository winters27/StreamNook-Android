// Cards settling into place the first time a list appears, so arriving on a
// screen lands on something with a bit of life rather than a grid that snaps in
// fully formed.
//
// TWO THINGS HERE ARE LOAD-BEARING, and both were learned the hard way.
//
// It does NOT use framer's `initial`. Every mobile screen renders inside the
// tab switcher's `AnimatePresence initial={false}` (MobileApp), which exists so
// the first tab does not slide in on boot. That flag rides PresenceContext and
// cascades to every motion component beneath it, so an `initial` anywhere down
// here is suppressed on the subtree's first render - exactly the launch and
// post-setup case this animation is for. Animating between two `animate` values
// instead sidesteps the context entirely.
//
// It latches. Pulling to refresh, appending the next page of an infinite
// scroll, or an item arriving on its own must not replay the whole shuffle.
// Once settled, later items simply appear.
//
// The line between "same list" and "new list" is the `resetKey`, and it is a
// judgement call per screen rather than a rule. Refreshing keeps the key,
// because the same cards come back the same shape. Switching between the card
// and list layouts changes it, because every row is reshaped and resized and
// the swap deserves to be animated rather than snapped. Running a new search
// changes it too.
//
// It needs no reduced-motion special case: framer snaps a reduced-motion
// animation to its target, and the target here is the item visible in place.

 * settle. That is the difference between a list growing and a list being
 * replaced: appending the next page of an infinite scroll keeps the same key so
 * new rows just appear, while running a new search swaps the key and the fresh
 * results settle in. Leave it out for a list that only ever has one identity.
