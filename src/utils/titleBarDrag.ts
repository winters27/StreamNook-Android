 * Pixels the pointer must travel before a MAXIMIZED window is handed to the OS drag

 * keeps double-click-to-restore working: the second click of a double-click never
 * travels far enough to trigger a drag, so it reaches the `detail === 2` branch below.
 *
 * A window that is already restored skips the threshold entirely and hands off on
 * mousedown, matching what `data-tauri-drag-region` did. Waiting for movement there
 * would start the OS loop from wherever the pointer had already reached, so a fast
 * flick would leave the window held some distance from where it was grabbed.

/**
 * Title bar drag handler, replacing `data-tauri-drag-region` on the main window.
 *
 * Mirrors Tauri's own drag-region script (exact element match so child controls stay
 * clickable, left button only, maximize on the second mousedown) and adds the
 * restore-from-maximized step Windows does not perform for a borderless window.
 * The restore itself happens Rust-side in one IPC hop: every extra hop between the
 * mousedown and `start_dragging` is a chance for the mouse button to come up first,
 * which leaves the window stuck to the cursor.
 *
 * `isMaximized` is the caller's tracked state rather than a fresh `isMaximized()`
 * call so the common path costs no IPC round trip. A stale value only picks the
 * wrong hand-off timing; the Rust side re-checks before restoring either way.
