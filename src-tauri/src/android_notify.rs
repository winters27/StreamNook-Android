//! Android-only bridge for work that runs with no Tauri app around it.
//!
//! Notifications have to keep arriving after the app is closed, and at that
//! point there is no WebView to listen for an event and no `AppHandle` to emit
//! one. A Kotlin worker calls straight into this library instead, so everything
//! here must work with nothing but a JVM pointer: no app handle, no running
//! event loop, and no assumption that Tauri's activity ever started.
//!
//! Verified on device 2026-08-02: `System.loadLibrary("streamnook_lib")` and a
//! JNI call both work from a WorkManager worker in a process Android started for
//! the job alone, in a release (R8) build.
//!
//! The reason this lives in Rust rather than in the worker's own Kotlin is
//! `TwitchService::get_token()`, which loads, checks expiry, refreshes against
//! the compiled-in client secret, and persists. Handing Kotlin a raw token
//! instead would mean the background poll dies the first time one expires while
//! the app has not been opened.
