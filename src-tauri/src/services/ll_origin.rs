//! Low-latency HLS origin for Twitch.
//!
//! Twitch low-latency channels ship chunked CMAF: each ~2s segment is ~19
//! `moof`+`mdat` fragment pairs (~105ms each), and the in-progress segment is
//! delivered progressively (the connection is held open while it encodes). The
//! `#EXT-X-TWITCH-PREFETCH` tag points at that in-progress segment.
//!
//! This module turns that into a real LL-HLS origin so hls.js (in `lowLatencyMode`)
//! can play ~2s from live instead of waiting a whole segment behind it (the ~5-6s
//! floor of whole-segment promotion). A background "edge reader" streams the
//! in-progress segment, splits it into parts the instant each `moof`+`mdat` lands,
//! and serves an LL-HLS playlist with `#EXT-X-PART` + blocking reload. hls.js fetches
//! each part as it appears.
//!
//! Verified hls.js 1.6.15 contract this implements:
//! - Low latency comes from BLOCKING the playlist reload (`_HLS_msn`/`_HLS_part`),
//!   then plain GETs of listed `#EXT-X-PART` URIs. `#EXT-X-PRELOAD-HINT` is ignored
//!   by hls.js, so we don't emit it.
//! - Only ever list a part whose bytes we already hold (a listed part that 404s with
//!   no alternate quality is a fatal, non-recovering freeze). Same for the blocking
//!   wait: bounded, then return the current playlist rather than hang.
//! - Always keep >=1 complete `#EXTINF` segment (an all-parts playlist trips
//!   "not enough fragments to start").
//! - Part URLs need not be stable across refreshes (parts match by (sn, partIndex)).
//!   The init segment (`#EXT-X-MAP`) is left as the stable absolute upstream URL.
//!
//! One `LlOrigin` instance serves one upstream stream. The solo relay uses the
//! shared module-level instance (facade functions at the bottom); MultiNook builds
//! one per tile so any number of low-latency grid tiles can run concurrently.
